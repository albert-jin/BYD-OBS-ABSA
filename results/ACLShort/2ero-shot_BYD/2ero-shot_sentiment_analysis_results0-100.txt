# Background context:Google is a multinational technology company known primarily for its search engine, which revolutionized the way information is accessed online. Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, Google quickly became synonymous with internet search due to its simple interface and powerful algorithms that delivered highly relevant results.

Beyond search, Google has expanded into various other areas of technology and services. It offers a wide range of products including cloud computing, advertising services, software applications like Google Drive (cloud storage), Google Docs (word processing), and Google Maps (mapping and navigation). Google's acquisition of YouTube in 2006 further solidified its presence in online video streaming.

The company's Android operating system dominates the global market for mobile devices, powering a majority of smartphones worldwide. Google also develops hardware products such as Pixel smartphones, Google Home smart speakers, and Nest smart home devices.

Google's business model revolves around advertising, particularly through its AdWords program, which allows businesses to place ads on its search engine and across its network. This advertising revenue has made Google one of the most profitable companies in the world.

In recent years, Google has faced scrutiny over issues related to privacy, data security, and its dominance in online advertising.
