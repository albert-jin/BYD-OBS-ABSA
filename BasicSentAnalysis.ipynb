The phrase \"in defense of\" typically indicates a positive stance or support for a topic, in this case, RSS.

The sentence \"Tomorrow is my final day at ITP\" sets the context that the aspect of focus is ITP (presumably a school or program). The sentiment expressed towards ITP is likely influenced by the phrase \"I\\'m just so happy this demanding course will end.\" The use of \"demanding\" suggests that the speaker has found the course challenging or difficult, possibly leading to some negative sentiments during the duration of the course. However, the overall sentiment in the sentence is positive, as the speaker expresses happiness and relief that the course is ending soon.

The quote \"It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring\" attributed to Alfred Adler reflects a critical perspective on human behavior and psychology. The phrase suggests a causal relationship between certain types of individuals and human failures, implying a potentially negative view or critique of aspects of human nature.
